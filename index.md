## Welcome to the CringeServer pages!

### Donations

I have made a meter for donations, to track our progress! Our current goal, as you can see, is 15$/month. Once we get that, I'll
be able to afford to run the server with better performance, as well as host a new server for modded or vanilla+ gameplay!

Good luck! Let's hope we reach the top.
